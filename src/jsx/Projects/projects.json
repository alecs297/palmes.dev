All students were provided with a subdomain, an apache server with PHP support, a code-server instance, a MySQL database and access to a file manager app. Everything ran in docker containers, on a server hosted in my living room, right next to my couch. It was a great experience, and I am proud of what we achieved : a fully functional hosting service, for free, for students, that was actually used !",
