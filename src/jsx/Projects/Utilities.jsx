I will rather spend 15 minutes writing a DOM scraper from the comfort of my Chrome's DevTools tab than spend 5 whole minutes copy / pasting data from a website to Excel. Programming is like a cake and automation is the cherry on top : you can never have too much cake. (not medical advice, use this quote at your own risk)"
